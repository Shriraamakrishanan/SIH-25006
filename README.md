## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for Implementing Biosecurity Measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
# Problem Description
## Background

Biosecurity forms the backbone of disease prevention in pig and poultry farming. Outbreaks like African Swine Fever (ASF), Classical Swine Fever (CSF), and Avian Influenza spread rapidly, causing massive economic losses and threatening farmer livelihoods. For small and marginal farmers, adopting structured biosecurity practices is difficult because:

#### 1. They lack awareness of disease-prevention protocols.

#### 2. They cannot access veterinary guidance on time.

#### 3. They struggle with documentation, compliance, and monitoring.

#### 4. Existing solutions are either too technical or not designed for rural accessibility.

## Problem Summary

Farmers urgently need a simple, digital, farm-friendly platform to help them understand, implement, and track biosecurity standards.
The proposed portal should:

#### 1. Provide customised risk assessments based on location, farm type, flock/herd size, and local disease threats.

#### 2. Offer interactive modules for cleaning, disinfection, waste disposal, and visitor management.

#### 3. Allow farmers to track biosecurity compliance and receive real-time outbreak alerts.

#### 4. Support multilingual, mobile-first, and offline-capable features.

#### 5. Facilitate data-driven decision-making for government, veterinarians, and extension workers.

#### 6. This system will increase disease preparedness, reduce losses, and promote safer livestock ecosystems across India.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a Digital Biosecurity Management Portal designed specifically for pig and poultry farms.
It functions as an end-to-end ecosystem with smart tools, learning modules, compliance tracking, and real-time monitoring.

### How the Solution Works

#### 1. Farmers register their farm details (species, farm layout, flock size).

#### 2. The system generates a Biosecurity Score using AI-driven risk assessment.

#### 3. The portal recommends custom protocols such as sanitation routines, isolation measures, feed/water management, and visitor restrictions.

#### 4. Farmers use the app to log daily and weekly activities, helping them stay compliant.

A real-time dashboard warns them about nearby disease outbreaks, biosecurity breaches, and environmental risk factors.

Training videos, quizzes, and visual checklists make learning simple and engaging.

### What Makes It Unique

#### 1. Uses farm layout mapping (like a mini digital twin) to calculate risk zones.

#### 2. Works offline to support remote villages.

#### 3. AI-based Farm Biosecurity Assist Bot answers farmer questions in simple language.

#### 4. Includes a collaboration network connecting veterinarians, paravets, and farmers.

#### 5. Secure, encrypted digital record-keeping for inspections and audits.

## Technical Approach
### Technologies Used

#### 1. Backend:
Python (FastAPI/Django), Node.js

#### 2. Frontend:
React.js / Flutter (for mobile app)

#### 3. Database: 
PostgreSQL (structured) + MongoDB (farm logs and images)

#### 4. AI/ML Models:

i)Risk scoring model (disease likelihood prediction)

ii)Image-based farm hygiene/contamination assessment

#### 5. GIS Mapping: Location-based disease alerts

#### 6. Cloud & Security: AWS/GCP, Role-based Access Control

### Implementation Methodology

#### 1. Requirement Analysis & Data Collection
Collect biosecurity guidelines, risk parameters, and disease indicators from field experts.

2. System Architecture Design
Modular microservices: Risk Engine, Learning Module, Record-System, Alert System.

#### 3.Prototype Development

 i)Web portal for farmers

ii)Mobile-first design for rural accessibility

#### 4)Integration of AI Modules

i)Risk score calculator

ii)Contamination detection from uploaded images

#### 5.Testing & Pilot Deployment
Deploy in selected pig and poultry clusters in Tamil Nadu / Punjab before scaling.

#### 6.Feedback and Optimization
Improve accuracy and usability with veterinary expert review.

## Feasibility and Viability
### Feasibility

1.The solution uses existing technologies (mobile apps, cloud, AI models).

2.Low-cost deployment suits small farmers.

3.Designed with multilingual support for diverse communities.

4.Can be integrated with existing DoAH&D programs.

### Potential Challenges

1.Farmers may not be familiar with digital tools.

2.Internet availability could be inconsistent.

3.AI model accuracy may depend on dataset quality.

4.Resistance to adopting new practices.

### Strategies to Mitigate Challenges

1.Offer offline mode + voice assistance for farmers with low literacy.

2.Provide training through veterinarians and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs).

3.Continuously refine AI using local biosecurity images.

4.Incentivize compliance (badges, rewards, certification).

## Impact and Benefits
### Impact on Farmers

1.Better preparedness for disease outbreaks.

2.Reduced mortality and lower economic losses.

3.Structured, easy-to-understand biosecurity practices.

4.Enhanced confidence among small and marginal farmers.

### Social Benefits

1.Safer meat production systems.

2.Healthier livestock improving rural livelihoods.

3.Reduced zoonotic disease risk to communities.

### Economic Benefits

1.Lower treatment costs through prevention.

2.Improved productivity and higher farm income.

3.Data-driven certification attracting better market demand.

### Environmental Benefits

1.Proper waste and carcass disposal reduces contamination.

2.Lower chemical overuse due to structured disinfection cycles.
